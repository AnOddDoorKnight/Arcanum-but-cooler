# REALLY IMPORTANT! NO, REALLY, READ THIS!
---
- The mod is currently in mid-stage development and as such spell values should be taken as final. Constructive feedback is appreciated as it will allow me to fine-tune the mod to be even more enjoyable.
- Some things are missing, such as more sounds and various effects. These will be added in time. Please don't ask me about them. I know they're missing. They will be added, have some patience.
- Some trees may also have very few spells. Again, WIP. I'd like to hear some feedback first before I add more spells. If this section disappears one day, that means the mod is actually fully fleshed-out.

### Important
- This mod requires [AceCoreLib](https://gitlab.com/accensi/hd-addons/acecorelib).
- To cast self/mass spells, look at your feet and summon a rune. When casting such spells, you must be within the sigil to be able to activate the runes.
- When casting targeted spells, you can only activate the runes from behind. There is an angle limit so you cannot not cheese runes from behind a corner.
- Touch spells require the rune to be within 2m of the target.
- Gold numbers denote values that change with spell level.

### Notes
---
- The Arcanum tome of knowledge can only be found in the world.
- Loadout code is `arc`.
- Configuration codes are:
	- `blues`: Starting blues.
- Catalyst is the amount of blues you need to have to begin casting a spell. Cost is what will be deducted upon casting.

### Incompatibilities
---
- Josh's Action Bubbles seems to make the rune activation not work unless you are crouching.
