### Important
- This mod requires [AceCoreLib](https://gitlab.com/accensi/hd-addons/acecorelib).
- To cast self/mass spells, look at your feet and summon a rune. When casting such spells, you must be within the sigil to be able to activate the runes.
- When casting targeted spells, you can only activate the runes from behind. There is an angle limit so you cannot not cheese runes from behind a corner.
- Touch spells require the rune to be within 2m of the target.
- Gold numbers denote values that change with spell level.
- When updating the mod after new spells have been added, use `ARC_ReInitSpells` to refresh the list. Existing spells will not be reset.

### Notes
---
- The Arcanum tome of knowledge can only be found in the world.
- Loadout code is `arc`.
- Configuration codes are:
	- `blues`: Starting blues.
- Catalyst is the amount of blues you need to have to begin casting a spell. Cost is what will be deducted upon casting.
- CVars are:
	- `arcanum_invert [true/false]`: Inverts the spell scroll direction of Fire/Alt-fire. Does not affect tree selection. Client-side CVar.

### Incompatibilities
---
- Josh's Action Bubbles seems to make the rune activation not work unless you are crouching.
